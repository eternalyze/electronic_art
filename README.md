# Electronic Art
Electronic beat-making purely in Python.

Big thanks to R1 for supplying me with a wavelet that didn't require fft or ifft. 

I was playing around with sine waves using the standard wave library until I realized something which fades in and out might sound more appealing. I remembered wavelets exist but when I tried to shift and manipulate their Fourier-based equations I thought there might be an easier way. I asked R1 for an equation which didn't involve fft or ifft calls. It generously provided me with python equation for the Ricker Wavelet. But it wasn't wavey enough so I added some sines in. Then I played around until I could produce some unique and truly alien sounds.
